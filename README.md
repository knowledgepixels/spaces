# Spaces

Spaces are global representations for all kinds of collaborative units.
They cover all publicly visible units where people come together for a particular purpose and to carry out activities to work towards that.
Academic activities are the main motivation, but Spaces generalize to all kinds of other domains.

## Categorization

Spaces can be subdivided into whether they are open-ended or time-limited, and with respect to what kind of focus activity they have:

|| open-ended | time-limited |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| focus on getting work done: | Groups | Projects |
| focus on outreach: | Outlets | Initiatives |
| focus on exchange: | Communities | Events |

This categorization is still work-in-progress, and is not meant to be exhaustive.

## Sub-spaces

Spaces can have sub-spaces by declaring _part-of_-relations among them.
Sub-spaces of time-limited spaces must be time-limited too.
