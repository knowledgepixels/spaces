# Spaces

Spaces are global representations for all kinds of collaborative units.
They cover all publicly visible units where people come together for a particular purpose and to carry out activities to work towards that.
Academic activities are the main motivation, but Spaces generalize to all kinds of other domains.

## Categorization

Spaces can be subdivided into whether they are open-ended or time-limited, and with respect to what kind of focus activity they have:

|| open-ended | time-limited |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| focus on getting work done: | Groups | Projects |
| focus on coordination: | Boards | Initiatives |
| focus on outreach: | Outlets | Campaigns |
| focus on exchange: | Communities | Events |

This categorization is still work-in-progress, and is not meant to be exhaustive.

All of these types can be formal (legal) or informal entities. Groups, for example, can be research groups at universities or informally formed groups like a reading club.

## Sub-spaces

Spaces can have sub-spaces by declaring _part-of_-relations among them.
Sub-spaces of time-limited spaces must be time-limited too.

For example, groups can have internal projects as they sub-spaces, communities can have initiatives, or events can have sub-events.

## Member roles

The most important parts of a Space are its members.
Members can have different roles, depeding on the type of Space, for example _speaker_ for an event or _editor-in-chief_ for an outlet.
All Spaces have the role of _owners_, which are the members that have the right to decide on the core features of the Space, such as its description and member admittance policy.
