# Spaces

Spaces are global representations for all kinds of collaborative units.
They cover all publicly visible units where people come together for a particular purpose and to carry out activities to work towards that.
Academic activities are the main motivation, but Spaces generalize to all kinds of other domains.

## Categorization

Spaces can be subdivided into whether they are open-ended or time-limited, and with respect to what kind of focus activity they have:

|| open-ended | time-limited |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| focus on bringing units together: | Alliance | Consortium |
| focus on formal vessel: | Organization | Taskforce |
| focus on structuring into sub-units: | Division | Taskunit |
| focus on getting work done: | Group | Project |
| focus on coordination: | Program | Initiative |
| focus on outreach: | Outlet | Campaign |
| focus on exchange: | Community | Event |

This categorization is still work-in-progress, and is not meant to be exhaustive.

## Sub-spaces

Spaces can have sub-spaces by declaring _part-of_-relations among them.
Sub-spaces of time-limited spaces must be time-limited too.

For example, groups can have internal projects as they sub-spaces, communities can have initiatives, or events can have sub-events.

## Member roles

The most important parts of a Space are its members.
Members can have different roles, depeding on the type of Space, for example _speaker_ for an event or _editor-in-chief_ for an outlet.

All Spaces have the predefined roles of _admins_, _maintainers_, and _members_, with edit privileges on these levels:

|| core | structure | content | suggestions |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| admin | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| maintainer | | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| member | | | ✓ | ✓ |
| _anyone_ | | | | ✓ |
